### Note on Environments

Even though suppliers allow two different environments(`production` and `sandbox`) we use 
the [same api](https://api.psrestful.com/docs) to handle both environments.

The values for the environments are:
- `PROD` for production
- `STAGING` for sandbox


In the case of `send_po`(purchase-orders) we need to specify the environment in the request body.

```json
{
  "environment": "STAGING",
  ...
}
```

For the rest of the endpoints we use a param in the query. For example:

### Staging(sandbox)

```url copy
https://api.psrestful.com/v2.0.0/suppliers/PCNA/sellable-products?environment=STAGING
```


### Production

```url copy
https://api.psrestful.com/v2.0.0/suppliers/PCNA/sellable-products?environment=PROD
```

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The environment param is case sensitive. If not environment is providec `PROD` is the default value.
