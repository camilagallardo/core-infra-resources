## Abstract and Recommended Audience

This document describes the technologies for integration of suppliers and distributors in the Promotional Products Industry. This document will discuss in detail the technology required in order to build the interface.

This document assumes that the reader is fluent in web based technologies and has knowledge of the programming language they plan to create or consume the web service with.

## Background Information

All specifications will be built using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) over HTTPS as the foundation for the web services protocol stack in order to provide a standards based secure form of communication.

More information on SOAP can be found at [http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/](http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/).

## Service Details

Function: getOrderStatus()

This function provides a mechanism to get order status by specific parameters such as purchase order number, sales order number, or transaction id. This allows the consumer of the service to obtain order status information grouped by purchase order number and sales order number for their needs. This function is required to implement.

### Request: GetOrderStatusRequest

| Field | Description | Data Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| wsVersion | The Standard Version of the Web Service being referenced | 64 STRING | TRUE |
| id | The id of the entity making the request or any other agreed upon Id | 64 STRING | TRUE |
| password | The password associated with the customerId | 64 STRING | FALSE |
| queryType | The type of query you wish to perform, see the queryType facet for acceptable values | FACET STRING | TRUE |
| referenceNumber | The purchase order number for queryType poSearch, the sales order number for queryType soSearch, or the transaction id for queryType transactionId. Required when any of these queryTypes are specified. | 64 STRING | FALSE |
| statusTimeStamp | Beginning datetime since last status change in UTC. This allows an entity to request status for any orders which have been updated since this datetime. Make sure to account for some jitter between the two systems and make sure to specify your time request in UTC and not in the local time zone. Required with queryType lastUpdate. | DATETIME | FALSE |
| returnIssueDetailType | Returns detailed information regarding order issues including recommended actions to resolve open issues if available when set to TRUE. See the returnIssueDetailsType facet for acceptable values. When this parameter is not included, the noIssues option is used. | FACET STRING | FALSE |
| returnProductDetail | Returns detailed information regarding the order/line item information when set to TRUE. The default value FALSE is used when this parameter is not included. | BOOLEAN | FALSE |

### Guidance

The ContactDetails object should include at a minimum an address, email, or phone.

All functions in this service have an optional array to return data and a ServiceMessageArray. As such, at least one array should be populated in the response.

Fields with the DATETIME data type are to be in UTC using the ISO 8601 format and not include a time zone. An example of a properly formatted ISO 8601 UTC date is 2022-06-14T15:26:32Z

There may be limitations with the amount of data that can be processed or returned with a call to GetOrderStatusRequest. An example is limiting the date search to 60 days. For cases such as this, you can return Service Message 125 - Not Supported with the appropriate severity.

It is recommended that the getOrderStatus function when called by lastUpdate supports going back at least a minimum of 7 days.

For Status at the order and product level. Issues such as a back order should be reported as the status even if the majority of items are not backordered. The worst status should be returned when there are products on the order with different statuses. If the preference is to discretely show backordered products for a purchase order, backordered products can be moved to another sales order.

For scenarios for a Purchase Order using Sales Order Number N/A.

- If the Purchase Order is still being processed or in a manual review, the Status returned should be _Order Received_ and any relevant details should be included in the additionalExplanation field.
- If the Purchase Order has been rejected, the Status returned should be _Canceled_ and any relevant details should be included in the additionalExplanation field.
- If the Purchase Order was not found, even when searching by transactionId, a service message with Code 220, No Orders were found for the requested criteria
