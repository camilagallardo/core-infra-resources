# Abstract and Recommended Audience

This document describes the technologies for integration of suppliers and distributors in the Promotional Products Industry. This document will discuss in detail the technology required in order to build the interface. Additionally, this document will provide sample code in order to use the interface.

This document will assume that the reader is fluent in web based technologies, and has knowledge of the language they plan to consume the web service in.

# Background Information

All specifications will be built using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) over HTTPS as the foundation for the web services protocol stack in order to provide a standards based secure form of communication.

More information on SOAP can be found at [http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/](http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/).
