## **Abstract and Recommended Audience**

This document describes the technologies for integration of suppliers and distributors in the Promotional Products Industry. It discusses the technology required to build the interface and provides sample code for using the interface. The reader should be fluent in web-based technologies and familiar with the language they plan to consume the web service in.

## **Background Information**

All specifications use the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) over HTTPS for a standards-based secure form of communication. More information on SOAP can be found at [w3.org](http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/).

## **Order Shipment Notification**

- **Summary:** Summary: Provides a mechanism to get shipment details by specific parameters like (purchase order
number, sales order number, or shipment date). This allows the consumer of the service to obtain
shipment information grouped by purchase order number and sales order number for their needs.

### **Function:** 
`getOrderShipmentNotification()`

### **REQUEST: GetOrderShipmentNotificationRequest**

   - **queryType 2 (SOSearch):** Query based on vendor assigned sales order number.
   - **queryType 3 (ShipDateSearch):** Query based on all shipments with a shipment date greater than the value specified in shipmentDateTimeStamp.
