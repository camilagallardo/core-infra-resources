# 🏗️ Introduction to Scrum at Core Infra  

Scrum is an **agile project management framework** designed to help teams develop software iteratively, adapt to change, and continuously improve. It is built on principles of **transparency, inspection, and adaptation**, making it well-suited for dynamic and collaborative development environments.  

At **Core Infra**, we follow Scrum to structure our work2flow, ensuring we stay aligned, address blockers efficiently, and keep our development process flexible. While traditional Scrum includes daily standups, we adapt the methodology to fit our team’s needs.  

## 🔄 How Scrum Works  

Scrum organizes work into **sprints**, which are fixed-length development cycles (usually 1–4 weeks). Each sprint follows a structured process:  

## Step 1: Sprint Planning  
Before each sprint, the team defines objectives and breaks them into **user stories** (small, actionable development tasks). These tasks are prioritized in a **backlog**, which acts as a roadmap for the project.  

## Step 2: Development & Collaboration  
During the sprint, developers work on their assigned tasks while staying in sync with the team through regular communication. Scrum typically involves **daily standups**, but at Core Infra, we primarily rely on async updates and weekly meetings.  

## Step 3: Weekly Scrum Meeting  
Instead of daily standups, we hold a **weekly Scrum meeting every Thursday at 8:30 AM at Snell Library**. This is our dedicated time to discuss progress, blockers, and upcoming priorities.  

## Step 4: Sprint Review & Retrospective  
At the end of the sprint, we review completed work, gather feedback, and reflect on what went well and what can be improved in the next sprint.  



## 📌 Key Principles of Scrum  

| **Principle**                 | **How It Works**                                |  
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|  
| **Iterative Development**     | Work is broken into sprints for continuous progress. |  
| **Collaboration**             | Regular meetings ensure alignment and accountability. |  
| **Transparency**              | Progress and blockers are openly discussed.     |

| **Self-Organizing Teams**      | Developers take ownership of tasks and problem-solving. |  

## 🛠️ Tools We Use
