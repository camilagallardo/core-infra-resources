# Function getAllAvaibableCharges

In order to get all the `available charges` for a paticular product we need to use Product, Pricing and Configuration service(PPC). Our API allows easy access by a `GET` request to our `available-charges` endpoint.


### HTTP VERB: `GET`
### URL: https://api.psrestful.com/v1.0.0/suppliers/{SUPPLIER_CODE}/available-charges/{PRODUCT_ID}/

### Example Response:

This is the response from calling with:   
`SUPPLIER_CODE` = `HIT`   
`PRODUCT_ID` = `55414`
