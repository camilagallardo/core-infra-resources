# Function getAvailableLocations

In order to get all the `available locations` for a paticular product we need to use Product, Pricing and Configuration service(PPC). Our API allows easy access by a `GET` request to our `available-locations` endpoint.


### HTTP VERB: `GET`
### URL: https://api.psrestful.com/v1.0.0/suppliers/{SUPPLIER_CODE}/available-locations/{PRODUCT_ID}/


### Example Response:

This is the response from calling with:   
`SUPPLIER_CODE` = `HIT`   
`PRODUCT_ID` = `7746`

**COMPLETE URL**: 
```url copy
https://api.psrestful.com/v1.0.0/suppliers/HIT/available-locations/7746/
```

```json copy
{
    "AvailableLocationArray": {
        "AvailableLocation": [
            {
                "locationId": 8,
                "locationName": "FRONT"
            },
            {
                "locationId": 9,
