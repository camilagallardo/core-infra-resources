## Function getOrderStatusDetails

In order to get `order status detail` for a given supplier we need to use Order Status Service(ODRSTAT). Our API allows easy access by a `GET` request to our `order-status-details` endpoint.


## Query Types

|  query_type | Short Name       | PSRESTful | Description                                                                                             |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | PO Search        | PO_SEARCH | Query based on customer provided purchase order number.                                                 |
| 2           | SO Search        | SO_SEARCH | Query based on vendor assigned sales order number.                                                      |
| 3           | Last Update Search | LAST_UPDATE_SEARCH | Query based on all orders with an update time greater than the value specified in `statusTimeStamp`.  |
| 4           | All Open Search  | ALL_OPEN_SEARCH | Query based on all orders that currently have a status other than “Complete” and “Cancelled”.           |

You can use it in several ways. If you know the `Purchase Order` or `Sales Order` you can pass that 
paremeter and also use the query type accordingly to `PO_SEARCH` or `SO_SEARCH`.
One very useful is to query by `ALL_OPEN_SEARCH`, in that case, the supplier will sending all the
 open Orders.

Of course, you can also search using `LAST_UPDATE_SEARCH` in combination with `status_timestamp`.

In summary, `ALL_OPEN_SEARCH` and `LAST_UPDATE_SEARCH` can be used to prepare a CRON Job so you can keep your system updated. 
`PO_SEARCH` and `SO_SEARCH` are useful to create a UI displaying the information for an order.
