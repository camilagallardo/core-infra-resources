# How to know all sellables from a supplier

The PromoStandards method/function/operation that allows getting all sellable products is `getProductSellable`.
We enable the direct call to this method using `sellable-products` path although we don't recommend this API call.

We have created two API operations to help you getting what you need but faster.
`sellable-product-ids` and `sellables`. They are similar, underliying we call the same SOAP operation but they both offers a different response.

Because, they have been cached, these two options are better.

Let's dive in.

## Function getProductSellable

In order to get `all sellable products` for a given product we need to use Product Data service(Product). Our API allows easy access by a `GET` request to our `sellable-products` endpoint.


### HTTP VERB: `GET`
### URL: https://api.psrestful.com/v2.0.0/suppliers/{SUPPLIER_CODE}/sellable-products/

### Example Response:

This is the response from calling with no parameter. The response have been truncated because it was too large.

**COMPLETE URL**: 
```url copy
https://api.psrestful.com/v2.0.0/suppliers/HIT/sellable-products/
```

```json copy
{
    "ProductSellableArray": {
        "ProductSellable": [
            {
                "productId": "1035",
                "partId": "1035ATHGLD",
                "culturePoint": null
            },
            {
                "productId": "1035",
                "partId": "1035BLK",
                "culturePoint": null
            },
            {
                "productId": "1035",
                "partId": "1035GRA",
                "culturePoint": null
            },
            {
                "productId": "1035",
                "partId": "1035GRK",
                "culturePoint": null
            },
            {
                "productId": "1035",
                "partId": "1035KHK",
                "culturePoint": null
            },
            {
                "productId": "1035",
                "partId": "1035NAV",
                "culturePoint": null
            },
            
 
           ...
        ]
    },
    "ServiceMessageArray": null
}
```

## Sellable Product Ids

In most cases, this is the API you need to use to get all the products that the supplier is able to sell.

A call to `/v{api_version}/suppliers/{supplier_code}/sellable-product-ids` will return a simpler JSON object
with the following format:

```json copy
{
    "count": 149,
    "products": [
        "KEPH",
        "TUSCANYBT",
        "IMPERIALW",
        ...
    ]
}
```

With this API you will be able to loop through all the product ids regardless if you want to update your catalogue, update your inventory, etc. 

It is a lot faster than the original because it doesn't have part information. In the PromoStandards version, Product information is getting dupplicated making some responses several megabytes long.

### HTTP VERB: `GET`
### URL: https://api.psrestful.com/v2.0.0/suppliers/{SUPPLIER_CODE}/sellable-product-ids/

### Example Response:

This is the response from calling with no parameter. The response have been truncated because it was too large.

**COMPLETE URL**: 
```url copy

```

```json copy
{
    "count": 149,
    "products": [
        "KEPH",
        "TUSCANYBT",
        "IMPERIALW",
        "DRI-16L",
        "SHOREBUDDY",
        "BT18",
        "TL-19",
        "PESH",
        "SUB-2242",
        "SPABP",
        "SC-35",
        "CH5060"
        ...
        
    ]
}
```

## Sellables

If you want also to know all the variants a product have without calling `getProduct` you can use `sellables` API.

`/v{api_version}/suppliers/{supplier_code}/sellables`

### HTTP VERB: `GET`
### URL: https://api.psrestful.com/v2.0.0/suppliers/{SUPPLIER_CODE}/sellables/

### Example Response:

This is the response from calling with no parameter. The response have been truncated because it was too large.

**COMPLETE URL**: 
```url copy
https://api.psrestful.com/v2.0.0/suppliers/HIT/sellables/
```

```json copy
{
    "count": 4163,
    "products": [
        {
            "productId": "1035",
            "variants": [
                "1035ROY",
                "1035NAV",
                "1035GRA",

            ],
            "no_variants": 13
        },
        {
            "productId": "2799",
            "variants": [
                "2799ORNORN",

                "2799BLUBLU"
            ],
            "no_variants": 9
        },
        ...
}
