## Function getOrderShipmentNotification

In order to get `order order shipment notification` for a given supplier we need to use Order Shipment Notification Service(OSN). Our API allows easy access by a `GET` request to our `order-shipment-notifications` endpoint.

An order can have shipment notifications once they reach the following statuses:
- Partially Shipped
- Shipped
- Complete

Hence, it doesn't make any sense to query by PO or SO search to orders in other statuses.

## Query Types

|  query_type | Short Name       | PSRESTful | Description                                                                                                    |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | PO Search        | PO_SEARCH | Query based on customer provided purchase order number.                                                        |
| 2           | SO Search        | SO_SEARCH | Query based on vendor assigned sales order number.                                                             |
| 3           | ShipDate Search  | SHIP_DATE_SEARCH | Query based on all shipments with a shipment date greater than the value specified in `shipmentDateTimeStamp`. |
