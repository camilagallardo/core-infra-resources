# 🚀 Welcome to Core Infra  

**Core Infrastructure (Core Infra) is the backbone of Code4Community (C4C),** providing essential tools and internal software that keep the organization running. Our team is responsible for building, maintaining, and improving the systems that power recruitment, project management, and other core operations.  

## 🌟 Our Mission  
Core Infra’s mission is to create **efficient, scalable, and user-friendly** internal tools that support C4C’s growth and help new developers onboard smoothly. Our work ensures that teams can focus on solving real-world problems without being slowed down by inefficient processes.  

## 🔧 This Semester’s Project: The C4C Recruitment Portal  

**Problem:**  
C4C’s recruitment process is currently scattered across Google Forms, Sheets, and Docs, leading to inefficiencies like:  
- Lack of centralized status tracking for applicants  
- No historical record of past applicants or application frequency  
- Manual, repetitive work for recruiters and admins  
- No built-in scheduling or interview coordination  

**Our Solution:**  
The **C4C Recruitment Portal** is a centralized, role-based platform designed to **streamline applicant tracking, evaluation, and decision-making**.  

### Key Features:  
✅ **For Applicants:** Real-time status tracking for full transparency  
✅ **For Recruiters:** A structured dashboard with application sorting, rating, and review features  
✅ **For Admins:** High-level control over applications, role management, and recruitment settings
